      <h1>Float Demo</h1>
      <p>
       Paragraph 1.
       This paragraph has the normal behaviour of a block-level element.
       It takes up the intire width of the page, and the next element
       is placed underneath.
      </p>

      <p class = "floated">
       Paragraph 2.
       This paragraph is floated left. It is placed to the left, and the
       next element will be placed to the right of it.
      </p>

      <p>
      Paragraph 3.
      This paragraph has no floating, width or margin. It takes whatever
      space it can to the right of the floated element, and then flows
      to the next line.
     </p>
